# C++ Learning Project  

This repository contains my code while I am reading the book *Beginning C++ Through Game Programming* by Michael Dawson.  
I am following the examples from the book and completing the exercises to improve my C++ skills.  

All code is written in `main.cpp`

Feel free to explore the code and follow my progress!
